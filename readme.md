Twitter
===

This is the beginning of (hopefully) a package of actions related to working with Twitter via OpenWhisk. Docs are rough, sorry.

You must pass args for:
* consumer_key
* cosumer_secret

**Actions**


GetTweets - returns an array of tweets matching search terms. Args support:

* account - return tweets from an account
* term - basic search term
